## ðŸŽ³ Bowling Game Scoring System (C++ Console Application)

This project is a **console-based Bowling Game scoring system** developed in C++ using **object-oriented principles**. It's designed to simulate a standard 10-frame bowling game for a single player, handling regular frames, strikes, spares, and bonus calculations.

### ðŸš€ Features

- Class-structured design (`Player`, `Frame`, `BowlingGame`)
- Complete frame-by-frame scoring logic
- Support for spares and strikes including bonus scoring
- Exception handling for invalid frame inputs
- Modular design for easy extension
- Unit tests for multiple game scenarios
- Visual Studio + CMake-compatible project structure

### ðŸ§± Class Structure

- **Frame**: Represents an individual bowling frame (tracks rolls, strike/spare status)
- **Player**: Stores frames and computes total score
- **BowlingGame**: Manages the game and player actions

### ðŸ§ª Test Cases Included

- Normal frames (no spares/strikes)
- All spares
- All strikes (perfect game)
- Mixed frames
- Invalid input edge cases

### ðŸ›  How to Run (Using Visual Studio)

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio (use CMake integration)
3. Build the solution
4. Set `main.cpp` or `test.cpp` as the startup file
5. Run to test gameplay or validate unit tests
